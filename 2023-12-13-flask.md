### views -decorators
```
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, debug=True)

You import the Flask class, giving the application access to the Flask functionality. You then create a
Flask application instance named app. Next, you connect the URL route "/" to the home() function by decorating
 it with @app.route("/"). Functions like these are commonly referred to as views in Flask. In this case, the
 home view returns a "Hello, World!" string that the browser can display.
