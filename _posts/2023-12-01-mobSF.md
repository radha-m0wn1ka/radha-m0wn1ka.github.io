## mobsf
```
It consists of a server component that runs on a host machine and a client component that is installed on the mobile device.
 The client component is responsible for collecting data from the mobile device, which is then analysed by the server component.
```
### features
```
Integration with CI/CD
Reverse Engineering
Static Analysis
Dynamic Analysis
Automated Security Scanning
```
### Static analysis
is a process of analysing the code of the mobile application without actually executing it.
### what does report contain
```
severity rating for each vulnerability,
vulnerabilities
components used
permissions asked
```
### dynamic analysis
```
Dynamic analysis is a process of analysing the behaviour of the mobile application while it is running

analysing the network traffic generated by the application,running the application in a simulated environment
how does dynamic analysis work
dynamic analysis of an Android or iOS application, you need to upload the application to MobSF and then install it on a device or emulator.
 Once the application is installed, you can use MobSF to capture the network traffic generated by the application
(URLs accessed by the application, the parameters passed in the requests, and the responses received from the server.)

### taint analysis
```
Taint analysis is a process used in information security to identify the flow of user input through a system to understand the security implications of the system design.

 The manifest file record also reveals the security flaws found in
the target application

### andorid emulator
```
in computing, an emulator is hardware or software that enables one computer system (called the host) to behave like another computer system (called the guest).
An Android emulator is a tool that creates virtual Android devices (with software and hardware) on your computer
