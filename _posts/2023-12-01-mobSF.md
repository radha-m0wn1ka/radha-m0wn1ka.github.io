## mobsf
```
It consists of a server component that runs on a host machine and a client component that is installed on the mobile device.
 The client component is responsible for collecting data from the mobile device, which is then analysed by the server component.
```
### features
```
Integration with CI/CD
Reverse Engineering
Static Analysis
Dynamic Analysis
Automated Security Scanning
```
### Static analysis
is a process of analysing the code of the mobile application without actually executing it.
### what does report contain
```
severity rating for each vulnerability,
vulnerabilities
components used
permissions asked
```
### dynamic analysis
```
Dynamic analysis is a process of analysing the behaviour of the mobile application while it is running

analysing the network traffic generated by the application,running the application in a simulated environment
how does dynamic analysis work
dynamic analysis of an Android or iOS application, you need to upload the application to MobSF and then install it on a device or emulator.
 Once the application is installed, you can use MobSF to capture the network traffic generated by the application
(URLs accessed by the application, the parameters passed in the requests, and the responses received from the server.)
```

```
in computing, an emulator is hardware or software that enables one computer system (called the host) to behave like another computer system (called the guest).
An Android emulator is a tool that creates virtual Android devices (with software and hardware) on your computer

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you. Poetry offers a lockfile to ensure repeatable installs, and can build your project for distribution

## nice basics

## smali dex
```
in mobsf analysis we can see a dedicated space for smali code and dex
Most Android applications are written in Java. Kotlin is also supported and interoperable with Java.  Instead of the Java code being run in Java Virtual Machine (JVM) like desktop applications, in Android, the Java is compiled to the _Dalvik Executable (DEX) bytecode_** format**. For earlier versions of Android, the bytecode was translated by the Dalvik virtual machine. For more recent versions of Android, the Android Runtime (ART) is used.
If developers, write in Java and the code is compiled to DEX bytecode, to reverse engineer, we work the opposite direction.
```
![image](https://github.com/radha-m0wn1ka/radha-m0wn1ka.github.io/assets/64199052/69ae058a-8dda-4fc7-ab47-c04762b2fdcd)
```
Smali is the human readable version of Dalvik bytecode. Technically, Smali and baksmali are the name of the tools (assembler and disassembler, respectively), but in Android, we often use the term “Smali” to refer to instructions. If you’ve done reverse engineering or computer architecture on compiled C/C++ code. SMALI is like the assembly language: between the higher level source code and the bytecode.
```
### intents
```
Intents are the primary means by which Android apps communicate between their components or with other apps
```
### components
These include: Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers and Providers.
####  activity
```
launcher activity
An Android activity is one screen of the Android app's user interface. In that way an Android activity is very similar to windows in a desktop application. An Android app may contain one or more activities, meaning one or more screens.
not every application will have a launcher activity, especially apps without a UI. Examples of applications without a UI (and thus a launcher activity) are pre-installed applications that perform services in the background, such as voicemail.
```
#### services
```
Services run in the background without a UI. They are used to perform long-running processes, even if the user starts using a different application.
```
#### webviews
```
WebViews
WebViews are effectively web browsers embedded into Android Apps.
WebViews content can be pulled from remote sites or can be files included in the app.
WebViews are vulnerable to the same vulnerabilities affecting any web browsers. However there are some configurations that can be useful to limit the attack surface.

## using api calls to automate mobsf
### resource
https://gist.github.com/ajinabraham/0f5de3b0c7b7d3665e54740b9f536d81
```
pip install the dependencies requests,requests_jsonbelt
activate virtaul env then run  run.bat 127.0.0.1:8000
in another terminal in the corresponding directory
run the present at the above git
the below error occurs ,we need to find the api key
may be try manually insert diva apk find strigs for api key and automate it 
```
![image](https://github.com/radha-m0wn1ka/radha-m0wn1ka.github.io/assets/64199052/ee6a3c69-6332-43e0-b6f2-6da48d2cfa72)

```
the api keys are not woking and the error reapring let us try another app for which we know api key
then modify the api calls code with our api key and new apk
can find api key in many apps manifest.xml 
```

by looking clerly the api key is differnt
so we must use our own api key for our local testing

still the same it cant find wkhtml to pdf
may be we have to restart not just the terminal through which we call api
may  be need to restart the mobsf as well
