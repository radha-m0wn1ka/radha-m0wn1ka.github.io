## cors
cross origin resource sharing
```
origin :defined by browser(IE wont consider port as part of origin)
scheme,domain,port=origin
```
## same origin policy
```
when u visit a site b ,site a
if in site b there is a request to site a let get request
then site a's cookies will be sent as well
hence our data will be at threat
usually sub domains have access to cookies of top domain
we  can use httponly flag to prevent it
for 2 websites such as a.b.com and b.com to talk to each other we can set
document.domain to b.com which will lead to treat them as same orign
```
## access control allow ___
```
this is a header set by person writing the server
origin :which origins are permitted to read the response
headers:which headers are allowed
methods:which methods like get ,post are allowed
a preflight request ,options will be sent first to check the cors configuration
based on the response the acatual request will be sent
```
## access control allow credentials
```
for the response with credentials to be rendered on broser
both parties must must explicitly say they are opting it
server:access control allow credentials:true
client:with credentials=true
CORS-preflight requests must never include credentials.
 The response to a preflight request must specify Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
to indicate that the actual request can be made with credentials.
When responding to a credentialed request:
allow methods,orign,headers,expose headers must not be a wildcard*

Set-Cookie response header in a response would not set a cookie if
 the Access-Control-Allow-Origin value in that response is the "*" wildcard rather an actual origin.
