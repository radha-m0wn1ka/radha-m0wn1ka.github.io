DOM-based XSS (also known as DOM XSS) arises when an application contains some client-side JavaScript that processes data from an untrusted source in an unsafe way, usually
by writing the data back to the DOM.

var results = document.getElementById('results');
results.innerHTML = 'You searched for: ' + search;
```
