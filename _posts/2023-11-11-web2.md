}

export function addThree(a, b, c) {
    console.log(a + b + c);
}
```
#### way2
```
function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}

function addThree(a, b, c) {
    console.log(a + b + c);
}

export { addTwo, addThree };
```
### default exporting 
default export is used when function name is same as file name
#### way1
```
function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}

export default addTwo;
```
#### way2
```
export default function addTwo(a, b) {
    console.log(a + b);
}
```
## imporing
### import default exported
```
import addTwo from "./addTwo";

// the rest of the mathOperations.js code goes here
```
#### import named exported 
```
import { addTwo } from "./addTwo";

// the rest of the mathOperations.js code goes here
```
