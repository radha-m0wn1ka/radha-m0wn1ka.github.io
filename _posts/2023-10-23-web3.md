## foundry
```
https://book.getfoundry.sh/
Foundry is a smart contract development toolchain.

Foundry manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line and via Solidity scripts.
- foundryup --help
- $ foundryup
- $ forge init hello_foundry
- This creates a new directory hello_foundry from the default template. This also initializes a new git repository.
- he default template comes with one dependency installed: Forge Standard Library. This is the preferred testing library
   used for Foundry projects. Additionally, the template also comes with an empty starter contract and a simple test.
  '''
  radha@DESKTOP-E4J3HG3:~/solidity/web3$ cd foundry_hello
  radha@DESKTOP-E4J3HG3:~/solidity/web3/foundry_hello$ ls
  README.md  foundry.toml  lib  script  src  test
'''
- $ forge build
- $ forge test
- the out directory contains your contract artifact, such as the ABI, while the cache is used by forge to only recompile what is necessary.
- use others project
  '''
  $ git clone https://github.com/abigger87/femplate
  $ cd femplate
  $ forge install
  '''
- We run forge install to install the submodule dependencies that are in the project.
- depnendinces
- Forge manages dependencies using git submodules by default, which means that it works with any GitHub repository that contains smart contracts.
- installation with foundry
- forge install transmissions11/solmate
```
### dependencies remapping
```
- in foundry.toml or
- You can customize these remappings by creating a remappings.txt file in the root of your project.
- in foundry.toml
  remappings = [
    "@solmate-utils/=lib/solmate/src/utils/",
  ]
we can imports contracts of src/utils by
  import "@solmate-utils/LibString.sol";
$ forge update <dep>
$ forge remove <dep>
 - Forge also supports Hardhat-style projects where dependencies are npm packages (stored in node_modules)
   and contracts are stored in contracts as opposed to src.
 - To enable Hardhat compatibility mode pass the --hh flag.
- For automatic Hardhat support you can also pass the --hh flag, which sets the following flags: --lib-paths node_modules --contracts contracts.
- Dependencies are stored as git submodules in lib/.
- ou can configure where Forge looks for both dependencies and contracts using the --lib-paths and --contracts flags
  respectively. Alternatively you can configure it in foundry.toml

### forge
```
Overview of Forge
Forge is a command-line tool that ships with Foundry. Forge tests, builds, and deploys your smart contracts.
Forge can run your tests with the forge test command. All tests are written in Solidity.
Forge will look for the tests anywhere in your source directory. Any contract with a function that starts with test is
 considered to be a test. Usually, tests will be placed in test/ by convention and end with .t.sol.
