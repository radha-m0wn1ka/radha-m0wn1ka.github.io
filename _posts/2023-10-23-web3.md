Foundry is a smart contract development toolchain.

Foundry manages your dependencies, compiles your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the command-line and via Solidity scripts.
- foundryup --help
- $ foundryup
- $ forge init hello_foundry
- This creates a new directory hello_foundry from the default template. This also initializes a new git repository.
- he default template comes with one dependency installed: Forge Standard Library. This is the preferred testing library
   used for Foundry projects. Additionally, the template also comes with an empty starter contract and a simple test.

  radha@DESKTOP-E4J3HG3:~/solidity/web3/foundry_hello$ ls

'''
- $ forge build
- $ forge test
- the out directory contains your contract artifact, such as the ABI, while the cache is used by forge to only recompile what is necessary.
- use others project
  '''
  $ git clone https://github.com/abigger87/femplate
  $ cd femplate
  $ forge install
  '''
- We run forge install to install the submodule dependencies that are in the project.
- depnendinces
- Forge manages dependencies using git submodules by default, which means that it works with any GitHub repository that contains smart contracts.
- installation with foundry
- forge install transmissions11/solmate
```
### dependencies remapping
```
- in foundry.toml or
- You can customize these remappings by creating a remappings.txt file in the root of your project.
- in foundry.toml
  remappings = [
    "@solmate-utils/=lib/solmate/src/utils/",
  ]
we can imports contracts of src/utils by
  import "@solmate-utils/LibString.sol";
$ forge update <dep>
$ forge remove <dep>
 - Forge also supports Hardhat-style projects where dependencies are npm packages (stored in node_modules)
   and contracts are stored in contracts as opposed to src.
 - To enable Hardhat compatibility mode pass the --hh flag.
- For automatic Hardhat support you can also pass the --hh flag, which sets the following flags: --lib-paths node_modules --contracts contracts.
- Dependencies are stored as git submodules in lib/.
- ou can configure where Forge looks for both dependencies and contracts using the --lib-paths and --contracts flags
  respectively. Alternatively you can configure it in foundry.toml

### forge
```
Overview of Forge
Forge is a command-line tool that ships with Foundry. Forge tests, builds, and deploys your smart contracts.
Forge can run your tests with the forge test command. All tests are written in Solidity.
Forge will look for the tests anywhere in your source directory. Any contract with a function that starts with test is
 considered to be a test. Usually, tests will be placed in test/ by convention and end with .t.sol.
```
### tests
```
-  most common way of writing tests, using the Forge Standard Library's Test contract, which is the preferred way of writing tests with Forge.
sample test contract
'''
pragma solidity 0.8.10;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract ContractBTest is Test {
    uint256 testNumber;

    function setUp() public {
        testNumber = 42;
    }

    function test_NumberIs42() public {
        assertEq(testNumber, 42);
    }

    function testFail_Subtract43() public {
        testNumber -= 43;
    }
}

'''
->setUp: An optional function invoked before each test case is run
->test: Functions prefixed with test are run as a test case.
->Tests are deployed to 0xb4c79daB8f259C7Aee6E5b2Aa729821864227e84. If you deploy a contract within your test, then 0xb4c...7e84 will be its deployer. If the contract deployed within a test gives special permissions to its deployer, such as Ownable.sol's onlyOwner modifier, then the test contract 0xb4c...7e84 will have those permissions.
->Test functions must have either external or public visibility. Functions declared as internal or private won't be picked up by Forge, even if they are prefixed with test.
->shared setups by using helper abstract contracts  https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/writing-tests
```
### depoyed to ,instance of
```
deployed to means creating an instance of the contract at a specific address,after effective deployment,contracts instance will be
created with a unique address,we can interanct with the contract with this address
```
### forge std library test
```
Forge Standard Library (Forge Std for short) is a collection of helpful contracts that make writing tests easier
, faster, and more user-friendly.

Using Forge Std is the preferred way of writing tests with Foundry.

Test.sol: A superset of DSTest containing standard libraries, a cheatcodes instance (vm), and Hardhat console
```
### cheetcodes 
```
->Cheatcodes allow you to change the block number, your identity, and more. They are invoked by calling
 specific functions on a specially designated address: 0x7109709ECfa91a80626fF3989D68f67F5b1DD12D.
->You can access cheatcodes easily via the vm instance available in Forge Standard Library's Test contract
just a test function
'''
pragma solidity 0.8.10;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

error Unauthorized();

contract OwnerUpOnly {
    address public immutable owner;
    uint256 public count;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function increment() external {
        if (msg.sender != owner) {
            revert Unauthorized();
        }
        count++;
    }
}

contract OwnerUpOnlyTest is Test {
    OwnerUpOnly upOnly;

    function setUp() public {
        upOnly = new OwnerUpOnly();
    }

    function test_IncrementAsOwner() public {
        assertEq(upOnly.count(), 0);
        upOnly.increment();
        assertEq(upOnly.count(), 1);
    }
 function testFail_IncrementAsNotOwner() public {
        vm.prank(address(0));
        upOnly.increment();
    }
 function test_RevertWhen_CallerIsNotOwner() public {
        vm.expectRevert(Unauthorized.selector);
        vm.prank(address(0));
        upOnly.increment();
    }
}
$ forge test -vvvv --match-test testFail_IncrementAsNotOwner
'''
```
### events
```
Events are inheritable members of contracts. When you emit an event, the arguments are stored on
 the blockchain. The indexed attribute can be added to a maximum of three parameters of an event
to form a data structure known as a "topic." Topics allow users to search for events on the blockchain.
EXPECT EMIT https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/expect-emit
```
### forking mode
```
To run all tests in a forked environment, such as a forked Ethereum mainnet, pass an RPC URL via the --fork-url flag:
forge test --fork-url <your_rpc_url>
->The following values are changed to reflect those of the chain at the moment of forking:
block_number,chain_id,gas_limit,gas_price,block_base_fee_per_gas,block_coinbase,block_timestamp,block_difficulty
->forge test --fork-url <your_rpc_url> --fork-block-number 1
forge clean to remove cache
->each fork is essentially an independent EVM with separated storage.
->Each fork is a standalone EVM, i.e. all forks use completely independent storage. The only exception is the state of the msg.sender and the test contract itself
->makePersistent.
```
### forge create
```
Forge can deploy smart contracts to a given network with the forge create command.
$ forge create --rpc-url <your_rpc_url> --private-key <your_private_key> src/MyContract.sol:MyContract
$ forge create --rpc-url <your_rpc_url> \
    --constructor-args "ForgeUSD" "FUSD" 18 1000000000000000000000 \
    --private-key <your_private_key> \
    --etherscan-api-key <your_etherscan_api_key> \
    --verify \
    src/MyToken.sol:MyToken

```
### cast
```
cast - Perform Ethereum RPC calls from the comfort of your command line.

cast abi-encode
```
### forge snapshot 
### interface abstract contract
```
https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-interface
->The Solidity interface can inherit from other interfaces
Contracts can inherit interfaces as they would inherit other contracts
You can override an interface function
->Data types defined inside interfaces can be accessed from other contracts
Abstract contracts possess at least one function that lacks implementation, and as a result, they cannot be compiled. However, abstract contracts can be used as base contracts from which other contracts can inherit.
->The interface cannot have any functions implemented
Functions of an interface can be only of type external
The interface cannot declare a constructor 
The interface cannot declare state variables 
```
