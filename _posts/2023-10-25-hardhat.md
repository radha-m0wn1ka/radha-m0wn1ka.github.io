->Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum software. It consists of different components for editing,
 compiling, debugging and deploying your smart contracts and dApps, all of which work together to create a complete development environment.
->Hardhat Runner is designed around the concepts of tasks and plugins
->npx hardhat compile runs the built-in compile
->By default, Hardhat will spin up a new in-memory instance of Hardhat Network on startup. It's also possible
 to run Hardhat Network in a standalone fashion so that external clients can connect to it. This could be a wallet, your Dapp front-end, or a script.

To run Hardhat Network in this way, run npx hardhat node:
$ npx hardhat node
Started HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:8545/
$npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
### hardhat runner
```
Hardhat Runner is the main component you interact with when using Hardhat. It's a flexible and extensible task runner that helps
you manage and automate the recurring tasks inherent to developing smart contracts and dApps
```
### hardhat network
```
Easily deploy your contracts, run tests and debug Solidity code without dealing with live environments. 
hardhat Network is a local Ethereum network designed for development.
```
### development
```
$npx hardhat init(use wsl2 for windows)
$npx hardhat
$npx hardhat compile
$npx hardhat test
$npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
### tests
```
https://hardhat.org/tutorial/testing-contracts
In our tests we're going to use ethers.js to interact with the Ethereum contract we built in the previous section, and we'll use Mocha as our test runner.
token.js in test folder
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("Token contract", function () {
  it("Deployment should assign the total supply of tokens to the owner", async function () {
    const [owner] = await ethers.getSigners();
//Signer in ethers.js is an object that represents an Ethereum account. It's used to send transactions to contracts and other accounts

    const hardhatToken = await ethers.deployContract("Token");

    const ownerBalance = await hardhatToken.balanceOf(owner.address);
    expect(await hardhatToken.totalSupply()).to.equal(ownerBalance);
  });
});
```
### signer in ethers.js
```
https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#Signer
```
### provider in ethers.js
```
https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#Provider
A Provider is the primary method to interact with the read-only content on Ethereum.
```
### deploy to  a specific network
```
https://hardhat.org/tutorial/deploying-to-a-live-network
in hardhat config js u need to add key
in deploy.js in scripts folder
async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

  console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

  const token = await ethers.deployContract("Token");

  console.log("Token address:", await token.getAddress());
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
