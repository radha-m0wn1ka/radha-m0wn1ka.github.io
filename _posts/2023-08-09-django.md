Django is a back-end server side web framework
Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template)
Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.



A view is a function or method that takes http requests as arguments, imports the relevant model(s), and finds out what data to send to the template, and returns the final result

Templates are often .html files, with HTML code describing the layout of a web page, but it can also be in other file formats to present other results

<p>My name is {{ firstname }}.</p>


Django also provides a way to navigate around the different pages in a website.

When a user requests a URL, Django decides which view it will send it to.

This is done in a file called urls.py

An app is a web application that has a specific meaning in your project, like a home page, a contact form, or a members
 database.

py manage.py startapp members
```

We have to tell Django that a new app is created.

This is done in the settings.py file in the my_tennis_club folder.

Look up the INSTALLED_APPS[] list and add the members app
then run py manage.py migrate
then restart server py manage.py runserver
```

```
Django creates a file describing the changes and stores the file in the /migrations/ folder
The table is not created yet, you will have to run one more command, then Django will create and execute an SQL statement, based on the content of the new file in the /migrations/ folder

py manage.py migrate
```
