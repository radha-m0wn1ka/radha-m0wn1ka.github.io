Django is a back-end server side web framework
Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template)
Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.



A view is a function or method that takes http requests as arguments, imports the relevant model(s), and finds out what data to send to the template, and returns the final result

Templates are often .html files, with HTML code describing the layout of a web page, but it can also be in other file formats to present other results

<p>My name is {{ firstname }}.</p>


Django also provides a way to navigate around the different pages in a website.

When a user requests a URL, Django decides which view it will send it to.

This is done in a file called urls.py
