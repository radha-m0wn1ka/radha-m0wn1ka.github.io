Synchronous applications such as gaming, telephony, WebSockets, and IoT are significantly affected by higher latency,
 but even asynchronous workloads, such as ecommerce applications, can suffer from an impact on user connectivity.
ways to interact with aws api::::::::::::
the aws management console(web based)
aws command line interface(download software and interact(create,configure),aws cloud shell
aws software development kits(was availble in many langs(python,ruby,.net(
if we have a application in python,want to use the storage of aws ,then ismply use python sdk


Every action you make in AWS is an API call that is authenticated
and authorized. In AWS, you can make API calls to services and resources
 through the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface
 (CLI), or the AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs).


.Developers commonly use AWS SDKs to integrate their application
 source code with AWS services. Letâ€™s say the frontend of the
 application runs in Python and every time it receives a cat
photo, it uploads that photo to a storage service. This action
can be achieved from within the source code by using the AWS SDK
for Python.

Here is an example of code you can implement to work with AWS resources using the Python AWS SDK.

import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_instances()

print(response)

```
identity and access management:------
there would be one aws account ,inside it we create multiple IAM users with various permission,we can create a ia
everything in aws is a api call
each api call must be signed and authoriesed/authenticated
are u authorised to launch a ec2 instance
IAM POLICIES CAN BE ATTACHED TO USERS OR GROUPS
IAM policies are json based documents
```

```
ec2 instaces need credentials to make signed api calles to amazon s3 to reading and writing images


IAM is global and not specific to any one Region. This means you can see and use your IAM configurations from any Region in the AWS Management Console.

grant or deny permsissions to take actions
actions are aws api calls
attack policies to aws identitites

```
for two services within a aws account we use iam roles
1 aws service assumes a role gains access to temporary credetntials sends api call to 2nd aws service  which verfies
aws assignes a role to a fedareted user when access is requested through an identity provider
